# Fruit Classification

Fruit Classification is a machine learning project designed for classifying images of fruits into different categories. This project leverages Inceptionv3 as the base model for high-performance image classification.

## Project Overview

The goal of the Fruit Classification project is to build a model capable of accurately classifying images of fruits into predefined categories. This model uses Inceptionv3 as its backbone to achieve state-of-the-art performance.
